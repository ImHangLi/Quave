# Quantum Types for qWhile+ Program Verification

This module implements the fundamental quantum types and operations required for the qWhile+
language verification system. It provides the mathematical foundation for quantum states,
variables, and registers.

## Main Concepts

* Hilbert Spaces: The mathematical framework for quantum states
  - Finite-dimensional complex vector spaces with inner products
  - Orthonormal bases for quantum state representation
  - Support for arbitrary dimensions (primarily used with dim = 2^n for n qubits)

* Quantum Variables:
  - Named quantum variables with associated Hilbert spaces
  - Support for initialization to basis states
  - Foundation for quantum arrays in qWhile+

* Quantum Registers:
  - Collections of quantum variables
  - Support for multi-qubit systems
  - Basis for implementing quantum gates and measurements

## Implementation Notes

1. State Representation:
   * Pure states as complex vectors in Hilbert space
   * Support for superposition and entanglement
   * Efficient basis state manipulation

2. Type Safety:
   * Strong typing for quantum variables
   * Dimension checking for operations
   * Preservation of quantum mechanical properties

3. Integration with qWhile+:
   * Support for quantum program syntax
   * Foundation for verification rules
   * Interface with classical variables

noncomputable section

/--
Complex conjugation of a number `z` in ℂ.
For a complex number z = a + bi, returns its conjugate z* = a - bi.

Example:
```
conj(1 + 2i) = 1 - 2i
```
-/
def conj (z : ℂ) : ℂ := ⟨z.re, -z.im⟩

/--
Inner product for two vectors in a Hilbert space, implementing the standard quantum mechanical
inner product (bra-ket notation).

Arguments:
* `dim` - The dimension of the Hilbert space
* `v1` - First vector (ket)
* `v2` - Second vector (bra)

Returns:
* The inner product ⟨v2|v1⟩ = Σᵢ v1ᵢ * v2ᵢ*

Properties:
* Conjugate symmetry: ⟨v|w⟩ = ⟨w|v⟩*
* Linearity in first argument
* Positive definiteness: ⟨v|v⟩ ≥ 0, with equality iff v = 0

Example:
For two-dimensional vectors:
⟨v₁|v₂⟩ = v₁₀*v₂₀* + v₁₁*v₂₁*
-/
def inner_product {dim : Nat} (v1 v2 : Fin dim → ℂ) : ℂ :=
  ∑ k, v1 k * conj (v2 k)

/--
A Hilbert space structure representing the mathematical framework for quantum states.

Fields:
* `dim` - Dimension of the Hilbert space (for n qubits, dim = 2^n)
* `basis` - Orthonormal basis vectors spanning the space
* `is_orthonormal` - Proof that the basis vectors are orthonormal

Properties:
* Complete inner product space
* Basis vectors satisfy orthonormality: ⟨eᵢ|eⱼ⟩ = δᵢⱼ
* Any state can be expressed as a linear combination of basis vectors

Example:
For a single qubit:
* dim = 2
* basis = {|0⟩, |1⟩}
* |0⟩ = (1,0), |1⟩ = (0,1)
-/

  dim : Nat
  basis : Fin dim → (Fin dim → ℂ)  -- Maps an index to a basis vector
  is_orthonormal : ∀ (i j : Fin dim),
    inner_product (basis i) (basis j) = if i = j then 1 else 0

/--
Creates a Hilbert space with the canonical (computational) basis.
This is the standard basis used in quantum computation where each basis vector
has a 1 in one position and 0s elsewhere.

Arguments:
* `d` - Dimension of the Hilbert space

Returns:
* A HilbertSpace structure with the canonical basis

Example:
For d = 2 (single qubit):
