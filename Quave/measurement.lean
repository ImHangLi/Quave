# Quantum Measurements for qWhile+ Program Verification

This module implements quantum measurements as specified in the qWhile+ language for quantum program
verification. It provides the mathematical foundation for quantum measurements and their effects on
quantum states during program execution.

## Main Concepts

* Measurement Operators: A set of operators {Mₘ} that describe quantum measurements
  - Each operator corresponds to a possible measurement outcome
  - Satisfies completeness relation: ∑ₘ Mₘ†Mₘ = I
  - Preserves positive semidefiniteness of quantum states

* Measurement Outcomes:
  - Classical values obtained from quantum measurements
  - Stored in classical variables in qWhile+ programs
  - Probabilities determined by Born rule: P(m) = ⟨ψ|Mₘ†Mₘ|ψ⟩

* Post-measurement States:
  - State update after measurement: |ψ'⟩ = Mₘ|ψ⟩/√P(m)
  - Ensures normalization is preserved
  - Reflects quantum state collapse

## Implementation Notes

1. Measurement Types:
   * Computational basis measurements (standard basis)
   * Measurements in arbitrary orthonormal bases
   * Partial measurements of multi-qubit systems
   * Support for POVM measurements (future extension)

2. Integration with qWhile+:
   * Implements measurement operation x := M[q₁,...,qₙ]
   * Supports measurement-based control flow
   * Maintains quantum/classical variable separation

3. Verification Support:
   * Preserves quantum mechanical properties
   * Supports reasoning about measurement probabilities
   * Enables verification of measurement-based programs

* Section 4.1: Quantum Predicates and Measurement

## TODOs

1. Implement tensor product structure for multi-qubit measurements
2. Add proofs for post-measurement state properties:
   * Positive semidefiniteness
   * Trace less than or equal to 1
3. Add common measurement examples:
   * Computational basis measurement
   * Pauli measurements
4. Integrate with CQState for full program semantics

Calculate the probability of measuring a specific basis state according to Born's rule.

Arguments:
* `state` - The quantum state vector to measure
